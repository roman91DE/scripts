# scripts

just a small collection of scripts to make life easier :-)

# usage

## option 1

clone the repository and add it to you path to use the program by calling its name without extension (this will call the symbolic links in the main folder)

## option 2

pick single scripts from the src folder and pull them manually, every script contains a short explanation at the top of the file
../..
